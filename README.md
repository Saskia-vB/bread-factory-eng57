### Description of project

This small project looks at using functions and TDD. 
We're also implementing Agile and Scrum principles. 

Topics covered include:
- functions
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile
- Scrum

### Functions
Functions are like people at work. They have one job! 
This makes it easier to test. 

#### How do they work? 
1) We need to define them, 
2) then call them.
3) They run the block of code that is idented. 

Other functionality:
- they can take in arguments to be dynamic and morph the output. 

If a variable is like a bow, you name it and place things inside. The bow does not interact with your stuff. i.e., if you name your box 'books' and place some potatoes inside, you do not get french fries.

A **function** is like a machine. It can interact with things you put inside. It can take inputs and follow a set of instructions (AKA the block of code)

#### Why functions? 
Because it keeps our code DRY:
- don't
- repeat
- yourself

Allows us to call said function to do the actions in the block. 

#### best practices of function
- name convention in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
- IT DOES ONE JOB!
- DON'T PRINT IN FUNCTIONS -> makes it hard for the program to use or test
- separation of concerns: where you design is not where you produce
    - helps remove signle point of failure in code, 
    - makes code more maintainable 
    
## Basis of a test
A test has know or controlled inputs and expect outputs. 
All it is, is an assertion. 

Unit test is the testing of one single function. 

You give it a known input, and you assert for expected output. 

Run it, get True or False.
